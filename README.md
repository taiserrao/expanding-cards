# About the project

https://taiserrao.github.io/expanding-cards/

Expanding Cards is an HTML, CSS and JavaScript webpage project at my learning journey called "50 projects in 50 days". With this project I could learn and improve my skills aboutHTML, CSS and JavaScript.

The project consists of a web page with The Last of Us theme where the user is able to select an image card for viewing.
